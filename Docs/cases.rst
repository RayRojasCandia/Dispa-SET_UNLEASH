Case Studies
============

In the past years, Dispa-SET has been used in various scientific works covering different geographical areas and with different focus points. It is originally designed to simulate EU countries (one node per country) but has also been applied to other regions such as Western Africa, Bolivia or the Balkans. The model includes the constraints linked to each generation unit (min/max power, ramping rates, efficiencies, storage capacities, etc.), to the interconnections and to the power and thermal demands. It uses high-resolution time series for the demands, renewable generation and outages in each simulated country.

The case studies for which scientific analysis has been carried out are summarized hereunder:
