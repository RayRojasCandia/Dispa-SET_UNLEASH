I have an allready existing file named as power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers.csv and its directory path is /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants
I want save them into two variables to be used in the future
first variable: power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers_file_name
second variable: power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers_file_path

in the other hand I have this allready defined variables
power_plants_raw_data_download_link_sources_file_name
power_plants_raw_data_download_link_sources_folder_path
zone_folder_name
zone_folder_path
power_plants_raw_data_file_name
power_plants_raw_data_download_link
power_plants_raw_data_file_headers
power_plants_clean_data_file_headers

I want to create a separated script to used it into the next cell which do the next:

open the csv file called power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers.csv using the variables power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers_file_name as the name and power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers_file_path as the path of the file
in a new empty row and in the columns epesified by the content of power_plants_clean_data_file_headers copy the content of power_plants_raw_data_file_headers


modify the last code but replasing the following:
power_plants_raw_data_download_link_sources_file_name as the name of the .csv file to be written in
power_plants_raw_data_download_link_sources_folder_path as the directory path of the .csv file to be written in

aditionally I want to write in the next empty row the following
in the column "zone_folder_name" write the value of the variable zone_folder_name
in the column "zone_folder_path" write the value of the variable zone_folder_path
in the column "file_name" write the value of the variable  power_plants_raw_data_file_name
in the column "download_link" write the value of the variable  power_plants_raw_data_download_link
