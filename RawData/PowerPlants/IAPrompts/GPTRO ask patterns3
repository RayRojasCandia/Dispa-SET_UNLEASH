Lest try again
I have a csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_clean_data_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/DE/2020.csv
The first four first rows are like this:
Unnamed: 0,Unit,PowerCapacity,Nunits,Zone,Zone_th,Zone_h2,Technology,Fuel,Efficiency,MinUpTime,MinDownTime,RampUpRate,RampDownRate,StartUpCost,NoLoadCost_pu,RampingCost,PartLoadMin,MinEfficiency,StartUpTime,CO2Intensity,CHPType,CHPPowerToHeat,CHPPowerLossFactor,CHPMaxHeat,COP,Tnominal,coef_COP_a,coef_COP_b,STOCapacity,STOSelfDischarge,STOMaxChargingPower,STOChargingEfficiency,WaterWithdrawal,WaterConsumption,Status,Source
,BNA0012a,13.0,1.0,DE,,,Steam turbine,Biomass and biogas,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BNetzA/UBA
,BNA0021,9.8,1.0,DE,,,Steam turbine,Biomass and biogas,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BNetzA/UBA
,BNA0027,138.9,1.0,DE,,,Steam turbine,Biomass and biogas,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BNetzA/UBA

I have a second csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies.csv

All the matrix is like this:

Lest supose I am looking for the value of the second row of the "Technology" column of the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path, that value is "Steam turbine".
So the script has to looking for the that value in the whole second file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path. We see that the value exist and is found in the collumn number 3 and row number 13. Know the script has to copy from the second file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path the value of the same row but in the second column; which is "STUR" and paste it in the first file power_plants_clean_data_file_path in the same cell of the valuel that was looked for, in this case it has to paste in the cell placed in the secon row and the column "Technology"
And so on with all cells of all rows of the in column "technology" of the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path.
If the condition do not complain, just copy the full row of the first file power_plants_clean_data_file_path to the third file power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units_file_path



I have a second csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies.csv
I have a third csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unl





no, the second file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path does not have a columna called Technology, just the first file power_plants_clean_data_file_path.

What I want to do is:

Read each cell of the column techology of the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path, and looking for if that value is in some part of all the second file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path

If it is, extract from second column of the file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path the content of the cell placed in the same row of the where the previous value was looked for.

Finally, if the condition do not complain for some cell of the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path, copy all the row of that cell to the empty file power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units_file_path
