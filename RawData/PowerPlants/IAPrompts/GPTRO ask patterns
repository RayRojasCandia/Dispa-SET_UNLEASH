I have a csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_clean_data_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/DE/2020.csv
I have a second csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies.csv
I have a third csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units.csv

the firts file has a header column with the name Technology.

I want to looking for if the value of each cell of the column "Technology" in the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path can be found in all the file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path

It it is true, I want to replace the respective cell of the column "Technology" in the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path with the value of the cell in the second column of the file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path in the row of the value founded

Finally, for all the cells that do not complain that condition, I want to copy all the row of the respective cell to the file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path





no, the second file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path does not have a columna called Technology, just the first file power_plants_clean_data_file_path.

What I want to do is:

Read each cell of the column techology of the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path, and looking for if that value is in some part of all the second file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path

If it is, extract from second column of the file power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path the content of the cell placed in the same row of the where the previous value was looked for.

Finally, if the condition do not complain for some cell of the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path, copy all the row of that cell to the empty file power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units_file_path







I want to take each cell of the column Technology of the firts csv file and looking for in the second csv file, if the same value is found replace that cell with the value of the its respective cell of the second column of the second csv file. If the value looked for is not found copy all the respective row to the next empty file of the third csv file

aditionally I have this variable:
Header_3: Nunits
Header_1: Unit
Header_2: PowerCapacity
I want to find the duplicated cells in the column called Unit, after I want to sum the values of their respective cell in the columns called Unit and PowerCapacity and put the results in the first duplicated row erasing the other ones 

count and identify all duplicated cells in the column Unit

all the rows of the csv file filtring that do not have the value of zone_folder_name: DE in the respective column called Zone
