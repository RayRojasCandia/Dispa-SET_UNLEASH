I have a csv file defined in the following variable and its contend:
power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers_file_name: ['power_plants_all_data_equivalent_headers.csv']
its path defined in the variable:
zone_folder_path: /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants
also this first file has this headers: Unit	PowerCapacity	Nunits	Zone	Zone_th	Zone_h2	Technology	Fuel	Efficiency	MinUpTime	MinDownTime	RampUpRate	RampDownRate	StartUpCost	NoLoadCost_pu	RampingCost	PartLoadMin	MinEfficiency	StartUpTime	CO2Intensity	CHPType	CHPPowerToHeat	CHPPowerLossFactor	CHPMaxHeat	COP	Tnominal	coef_COP_a	coef_COP_b	STOCapacity	STOSelfDischarge	STOMaxChargingPower	STOChargingEfficiency	WaterWithdrawal	WaterConsumption
also I have this variable and its contentd: 
power_plants_raw_data_file_headers: ['name', 'capacity', 'country', 'energy_source', 'technology', 'chp', 'source']
each word into simple quotation marks is a data that I want to copy in a diferent column of the csv file
The way to chose the columns of each word has to go I want to defiying using the content of the following variable
power_plants_clean_data_file_headers ['Unit', 'PowerCapacity', 'Zone', 'Fuel', 'Technology', 'CHPType', 'Source']


the second has this headers: name	company	street	postcode	city	country	capacity	energy_source	technology	chp	commissioned	type	lat	lon	eic_code	energy_source_level_1	energy_source_level_2	energy_source_level_3	additional_info	comment	source
I want to copy determined headers, not all, of the second file to the next empty new row of the first file
The headers to be copied are already specified in the variable power_plants_raw_data_file_headers
the headres of the columns where to copy are already specified in the variable power_plants_clean_data_file_headers
