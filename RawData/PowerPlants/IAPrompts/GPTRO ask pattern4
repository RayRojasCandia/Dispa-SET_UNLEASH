I have a csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_clean_data_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/DE/2020.csv
its eitgthed columns is called has "technology"
I have a second csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/power_plants_all_data_equivalent_technologies.csv
its second and third columns is called "Dispaset_Technology" and "Equivalent_Technology"
I have a third csv file defined with the following variable and its value:
power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units_file_path = /home/ray/Dispa-SET_Unleash/RawData/PowerPlants/power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units.csv

I want to looking for the value in each cell from the column "technology" in the column "Equivalent_Technology", it the value matches, copy the corresponding value of the column "Dispaset_Technology" and paste it in the column "technology". If the value from from the column "technology" does not matches to any value of the column "Equivalent_Technology", copy the corresponded row to the next empty file of power_plants_all_data_not_defined_units_file_path and erase the row of the file power_plants_clean_data_file_path
